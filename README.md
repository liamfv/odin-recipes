In this project, I constructed a simple recipe website using HTML only.
The website has a homepage, and in that homepage there is an unordered list that links to three separate recipes.
The recipes are in subdirectories, so I used relative links to navigate to them.
Each recipe has a title in a h1 header, followed by an image. 
Every image has a source with an absolute link and alt attribute. 
Each recipe contains an unordered list detailing the ingredients, and an ordered list detailing the steps to cook the recipe.
I used the strong element to add bold to some parts of the ingredients. Maybe should use just the bold element next time.
I also used the br element when I needed to add a break in lines when they became too long. 
At the end of the page I would always add a relative link that helped me navigate back to the homepage.
This was a fun simple project that was very easy and fun to do. This was my first time really using relative links.
One thing I forgot to do more often was commit changes, but I think I did ok. Could always be better. 
Lastly, I got all my recipes from allrecipes.com
