        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
                <li>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                    <br>Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; 
                    <br>it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. 
                    <br>Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. 
                    <br>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. 
                    <br>Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. 
                    <br>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
                <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. 
                    <br>Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. 
                    <br>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
